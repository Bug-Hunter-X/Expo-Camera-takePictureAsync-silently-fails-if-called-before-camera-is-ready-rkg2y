This error occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API and attempting to access the `takePictureAsync` method before the camera has finished loading.  This often manifests as a silent failure, where no image is captured and no error is explicitly thrown.  The promise returned by `takePictureAsync` resolves to `undefined`.
